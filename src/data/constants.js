  description: "I am a versatile engineer with a solid foundation in both hardware and software, driven by curiosity and a mission to understand how technology we use everyday works.\n\nMy academic journey reflects this dual expertise: I began with a hardware-centric focus during my bachelor's in Electrical Engineering, mastering areas like electronics, circuits, embedded programming, and digital logic. Transitioning into my master's, I shifted to the software side, honing skills in networking, distributed/cloud computing, programming, and IoT.\n\nThis blend of disciplines has made me proficient in languages such as Python and C/C++, with hands-on experience in Docker, Kubernetes, and data pipeline development. On the hardware side, I have skills in embedded systems programming, PCB design, and circuit design, enabling me to develop comprehensive, integrated solutions.",
